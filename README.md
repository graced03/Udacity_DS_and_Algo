# Udacity_DS_and_Algo
Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Nanodegree Program from Udacity

Here I include the course content and my answers for the four main projects in the Data Structure and Algorithm Nanodegree Program from Udacity.
This github is inspired by Axel Bravo's github project (19_udacity_dsa, https://github.com/Axel-Bravo/19_udacity_dsa) where he provides his work during the study of this program. Here I also give out my answers for the main projects for general reference and inspiration for students either taking the course or learning data structure and algorithms.
